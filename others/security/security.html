                <p>Our data centers are hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). As such, they are continuously audited with certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and verticals.</p>
                <p>Our application architecture, database encryption, and access are secured, controlled, audited, and monitored by our in-house engineers.</p>

                <p>We keep our infrastructure updated with scheduled security maintenance updates, as well as applying any patches that are recommended to be rolled out immediately.</p>
                <p>Similarly, we patch our application code very quickly when vulnerabilities are discovered. That's why we're committed to set the new standard of trust online, and we look forward to working with the security community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our users safe.</p>
                <p>If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in any Kinetic product you can report it through our vulnerability program.</p>
            </div>

                <h1>Proactive Monitoring</h1>
                <p>We use redundant, world-wide monitoring services to monitor Kinetic's infrastructure 24x7x365. Any errors or other abnormalities trigger automatic alarms and we proactively work on fixing any issues detected.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Reliable and secure service you can trust</h1>

                    <li>security controls which protect our infrastructure from external attack and unauthorised access; and</li>
                    <li>internal policies setting out our data approach and training for employees</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
